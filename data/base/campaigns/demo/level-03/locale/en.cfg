think-find-ship=I could really use some equipment from our crashed ship.
think-no-idea-where-to-start=The problem is that I have no idea where to start looking.
think-use-radar=Maybe I could build a simple __ENTITY__radar__ to locate the ship.
think-make-electricity=But first I'll need electric power.
think-build-pump=I could pump and boil water and feed it into the __ENTITY__steam-engine__.
goal-build-pump=Build a __ENTITY__pump__ on a straight water/ground transition.
goal-build-boiler=Build __ENTITY__boiler__.
goal-connect-boiler-to-water=Build __ENTITY__pipe__s to get the water from the __ENTITY__pump__ into the __ENTITY__boiler__.
goal-connect-steam-engine-to-water=Build __ENTITY__pipe__s to get the water from the __ENTITY__boiler__ into the __ENTITY__steam-engine__.
goal-fuel-into-boiler=Put fuel inside the __ENTITY__boiler__.
goal-build-steam-engine=Build a __ENTITY__steam-engine__ connected to the __ENTITY__boiler__.
msg-steam-engine-introduction-1=There are more ways to build __ENTITY__steam-engine__s. Like this:
msg-steam-engine-introduction-2=Or this:
msg-steam-engine-effectivity=The __ENTITY__steam-engine__'s efficiency is highest when it gets water at 100 degrees.
msg-have-electricity=Now you can use electricity to power __ENTITY__basic-mining-drill__s and __ENTITY__basic-inserter__s.
goal-build-electric-mining-drill=Build a __ENTITY__basic-mining-drill__ on top of some resources.
goal-power-electric-mining-drill=Connect the __ENTITY__basic-mining-drill__ to the power grid. You need to use __ENTITY__small-electric-pole__s for that.
msg-factory-instruction-1=Very good. Now use electricity to make sure there is a steady flow of __ENTITY__coal__ going into your __ENTITY__boiler__s.
msg-factory-instruction-2=Then set up __ENTITY__stone-furnace__s to smelt __ENTITY__iron-ore__ and __ENTITY__copper-ore__.
msg-factory-instruction-3=Lastly, build __ENTITY__radar__s to scan the surrounding territory.
think-get-to-work=Alright, let's get to work.
think-beware-of-creepers=I hope I don't attract too many __ENTITY__creeper__s.
goal-radar-progress=Use __ENTITY__radar__s to scan the surrounding territory.\nSectors scanned: __1__/__2__
msg-sector-scan-completed=Sector scan complete.
msg-ship-wreck-located=Small shipwreck located to the southeast.
think-explore-ship-wreck=Alright, it's time to explore that area.
think-better-place-for-mining-drill=Maybe there's a better place to build this __ENTITY__basic-mining-drill__.
think-better-place-for-steam-engine=Maybe there's a better place to build this __ENTITY__steam-engine__.
msg-need-better-weapon=This __ITEM__pistol__ won't be enough to hold them. I should make a __ITEM__submachine-gun__.
msg-need-better-defense=I won't be able to hold it on my own, I could use the __ENTITY__gun-turret__ to defend my base.
msg-need-light=It's getting dark, I should build __ENTITY__small-lamp__s.
