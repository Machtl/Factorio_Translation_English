msg-escaped=I got the data, but there was no going back.
msg-enemy=It appears their numbers are larger than I expected and they're already looking for me.
msg-escape=I can't fight them back for much longer, not with this level of technology. I need a way out to some other continent. That'll buy me some time to get ready.
msg-research-flight=I need to research flight in order to do that.
goal-research-flight=Research flight.
goal-next-attack=Next attack in __1__.
msg-finished=I made it, I escaped, I never thought I'd make it!
msg-go-away=Let's go to some quiet place. Some place far away.
epilogue=Congratulations, you have finished the basic campaign.\n\nThere is plenty more that you can do in the Factorio. You can go and play the Freeplay. That is one long survival game which combines all of the mechanisms currently present in the game (automating production, research, combat). Or you can try the sandbox scenario and just build whatever you want - there is no goal and no enemies. You can also check out our challenge scenario pack (requires Furnace Attendant membership or higher). There you will be solving logistic puzzles and racing with time to build specialized factories.
